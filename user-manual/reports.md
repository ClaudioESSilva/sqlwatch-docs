# Reports

Reports are a standalone module that can be run on a set schedule, or triggered by an action.

For example, we can have a daily "Status" report or even a business process saving generated file to a shared drive.

Actions can also trigger a report. For example, we can have a Check to check for space left on drives and send us a report when the thresholds are low.R
